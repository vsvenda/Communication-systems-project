# Communication-systems-project

This was the final project for EE107 Communication Systems course.

For this project, a model of a communications system that transmits an image from one place to another has been developed, much like digital television (HDTV). 
The image is transmitted through the following blocks: 1) Image pre-processing; 2) Conversion to bit stream; 3) Modulation; 4) Channel; 5) Matched Filter; 6) Received Equalizer; 7) Sampling and detection; 8) Conversion to an image; and 9) Image post-processing.

Each of these function blocks has been implemented in MATLAB. Combining all of them, we are able to simulate an image transmission from one place to another.

An example image "Elephant.jpg" which can be transfered through the system is also provided.
